# Archived Documentation

This folder contains historical debug logs, fix documentation, and implementation summaries
that have been archived to keep the main documentation clean.

## Contents

These files document past development work including:
- Debug session logs
- Fix documentation (USB, CLI, MIOS, etc.)
- Implementation summaries
- Temporary status reports

## Note

Most information in these files has been superseded by the current documentation in:
- `Docs/README.md` - Main documentation index
- `Docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` - Current architecture guide
- `Docs/development/` - Development documentation
- `Docs/testing/` - Testing procedures

If you need to reference historical decisions or fixes, browse these files.
Otherwise, use the main documentation structure.
