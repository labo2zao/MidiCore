# Enable one-shot calibration at boot.
# Steps:
# 1) Hold bellows at rest (no push/pull) during ATM_MS to measure atmospheric baseline.
# 2) Then do full push/pull during EXT_MS to measure min/max range.
# Results:
# - Writes ATM0_PA, PMIN_PA, PMAX_PA into pressure.ngc
# - Writes RAW_MIN/RAW_MAX into expression.ngc (mapped range, with margins)
