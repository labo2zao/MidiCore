# Future enhancement - not yet implemented in config_io.c
# This file shows the planned format for Rhythm Trainer configuration

# Rhythm Trainer Settings
# =============================================================================

# Enable rhythm trainer on startup
# 0 = disabled, 1 = enabled

# Difficulty preset
# 0 = EASY, 1 = MEDIUM, 2 = HARD, 3 = EXPERT
RHYTHM_DIFFICULTY = 1

# Subdivision for beat detection
# 0 = 1/4 notes, 1 = 1/8 notes, 2 = 1/16 notes, 3 = 1/32 notes

# Range: 1-50 ticks
# 1 tick ≈ 2.6ms @ 96 PPQN, 120 BPM

# Good timing window in ticks (±ticks around beat)
# Range: 2-100 ticks
# Must be larger than perfect window
RHYTHM_GOOD_TICKS = 24

# Off timing threshold in ticks
# Notes beyond this are marked as "OFF"
# Range: 10-200 ticks
RHYTHM_OFF_TICKS = 96

# Audio feedback mode
# 0 = NONE (visual only)
# 1 = MUTE (silence off-beat notes)
# 2 = WARNING (play alert sound for errors)

# Warning sound MIDI note (for WARNING mode)
# Default: 38 (snare drum on GM channel 10)

# Warning sound velocity
# Range: 1-127

# Warning sound MIDI channel
# Range: 0-15 (0 = channel 1, 9 = channel 10/drums)

# Adaptive mode
# 0 = disabled, 1 = enabled
# When enabled, thresholds automatically tighten as accuracy improves

# Range: 50-100

# =============================================================================
# Difficulty Preset Reference
# =============================================================================
# EASY (0):
#   Perfect: ±24 ticks (±60ms @ 120bpm)
#   Good:    ±48 ticks (±120ms @ 120bpm)
#
# MEDIUM (1):
#   Perfect: ±12 ticks (±30ms @ 120bpm)
#   Good:    ±24 ticks (±60ms @ 120bpm)
#
# HARD (2):
#   Perfect: ±6 ticks (±15ms @ 120bpm)
#   Good:    ±16 ticks (±40ms @ 120bpm)
#
# EXPERT (3):
#   Perfect: ±4 ticks (±10ms @ 120bpm)
#   Good:    ±12 ticks (±30ms @ 120bpm)

# Note: Selecting a difficulty preset overrides manual threshold settings
